## About Redstone Designer
### What's this?
This is an open source Minecraft redstone circuit designer. You can build and save your redstone device easily.
### Why I need it?
Because I think we can't save redstone devices(circuits) easily, even we can save redstone devices(circuits) as structures, but if you want to customize the redstone devices(circuits), you must execute many operations, these steps will take a lot of time. So I developmented this software. It can make you design and export redstone device(circuits) easily.
### Is this software free?
Yes, this software uses GNU General Public License v3.0. You can get its binary releases and source codes freely if you agree the license.
